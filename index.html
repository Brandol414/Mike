                <p>Healthcare is not something that happens TO you‚Äîit's something you participate IN. Every day, millions of people walk into medical offices feeling like passive recipients of care, when they could be active partners in their own health journey.</p>

            <div class="page-content">
                <p>As a patient, you have fundamental rights that protect your dignity, privacy, and autonomy. These aren't privileges‚Äîthey're entitlements that every healthcare provider must respect.</p>

                <div class="key-point">
                    Always ask: What is my diagnosis? What are my treatment options? What are the risks and benefits? How will we know if it's working?
